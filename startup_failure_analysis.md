# Complete Startup Failure Sequence Analysis

## Trace Summary

The startup failure occurs due to **missing Python dependencies** when running locally. Here's the exact sequence:

### 1. start.py runs successfully (✓)
- Executes with Python 3 (via shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- Uses only standard library modules (os, sys, time, logging, pathlib)
- No external dependencies required

### 2. Creates all directories (✓)
- Creates: output, processing, posted, logs, database, assets/watermarks, assets/logos
- All directories created successfully with proper permissions (0o755)

### 3. Creates database file (✓)
- Creates `/app/database/tiktok.db` (or local equivalent)
- Sets permissions to 0o666
- Sets environment variables:
  - `DATABASE_PATH` = absolute path to tiktok.db
  - `DATABASE_URL` = sqlite:///[absolute path]

### 4. Database accessible check (✓)
- Uses standard library `sqlite3` module
- Successfully connects and executes `SELECT 1`
- No SQLAlchemy dependency needed at this stage

### 5. Shows "Starting main automation system" (✓)
- Prints message successfully
- Attempts to import dependencies

### 6. FAILS on import DatabaseQueries (✗)
- Exact failure path:
  ```
  start.py line 143: from src.database.migrations import run_migrations
  → migrations.py line 5: from src.database.models import Base
  → models.py line 6: from sqlalchemy import create_engine, ...
  → ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'
  ```

### 7. Falls back to health check mode (✓)
- Catches ImportError exception (line 148)
- Logs error and continues in health check loop
- Container stays alive as designed

## Root Cause

The failure is **NOT** a database path issue. It's a **missing dependency issue**.

### Key Findings:

1. **Local vs Container Environment**: 
   - In the Docker container, SQLAlchemy is installed via requirements.txt
   - When running locally, SQLAlchemy is not installed
   - The code assumes it's running in a containerized environment with dependencies

2. **Import-time Database Creation**:
   - `models.py` line 207 executes `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` at module import time
   - This requires SQLAlchemy to be installed just to import the module
   - Even if we're not using the database, the import fails

3. **Python Version Issue** (secondary):
   - The default `python` command points to Python 2.7.12
   - The code requires Python 3 (uses f-strings, type hints, etc.)
   - The shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` ensures correct version when executed directly

## Solution

For local testing without installing dependencies:

1. **Use Docker**: The intended deployment method
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Install dependencies locally**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a minimal test environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

## Container Behavior

In the actual container:
- All dependencies are pre-installed
- The import succeeds
- If API keys are missing, it gracefully falls back to health check mode
- The container stays alive for DigitalOcean App Platform requirements

## Verification

To verify this is the issue:
```bash
# Check if sqlalchemy is installed
python3 -c "import sqlalchemy; print('SQLAlchemy is installed')"
```

If this fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`, that confirms the analysis.
