# TikTok Pipeline Initialization Status

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Pipeline setup attempted

## üîç Current Findings:

### ‚úÖ What's Ready:
1. **Transit Scripts**: Found multiple transit scripts in `/scripts/` directory
   - `mac_transit.py` - Main transit script (updated with DO URL)
   - `simple_transit.py` - Simple version
   - `zero_storage_transit.py` - Zero storage implementation

2. **Cookies**: Located at `config/youtube_cookies.txt`

3. **Video Processor**: Deployed in previous sessions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found:

1. **DigitalOcean App**: The app at `https://tiktok-automation-xqbnb.ondigitalocean.app` is not responding
   - This could mean:
     - App is still building/deploying from the recent Docker fix
     - App crashed during startup
     - URL has changed

2. **Missing Dependencies**: Local Mac doesn't have required Python packages
   - `requests` module not installed
   - `yt-dlp` not available in PATH

## üìã Next Steps:

### Option 1: Check DigitalOcean Dashboard
1. Log into DigitalOcean
2. Navigate to Apps section
3. Check the app status and logs
4. Get the current app URL if it changed

### Option 2: Install Dependencies Locally
```bash
# Install yt-dlp
brew install yt-dlp
# OR
pip3 install yt-dlp

# Install Python packages
pip3 install requests
```

### Option 3: Manual Test Upload
Once the DO app is running, you can manually test:

```bash
# Download a test video
yt-dlp --cookies config/youtube_cookies.txt \
       -f "best[height<=720]" \
       -o "test_video.mp4" \
       "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScMzIvxBSi4"

# Upload to DO (replace URL if needed)
curl -X POST https://YOUR-APP.ondigitalocean.app/api/upload \
     -F "video=@test_video.mp4" \
     -F "video_id=test_1"

# Clean up
rm test_video.mp4
```

### Option 4: Use Existing Scripts
Once DO app is up, the transit scripts are ready to use:

```bash
# Run the main transit script
python3 scripts/mac_transit.py

# Or the simple version
python3 scripts/simple_transit.py
```

## üöÄ Quick Recovery Plan:

1. **Check DO app status** in the DigitalOcean dashboard
2. **Wait for deployment** to complete (if still building)
3. **Update the DO URL** in scripts if it changed
4. **Run transit script** to start processing videos

## üìä Expected Timeline:

- DO app deployment: 5-10 minutes after Docker fix
- First video upload: 2-3 minutes after script starts
- Clip processing: 5-10 minutes per video
- Dashboard available: Immediately after app deploys

**Note**: The pipeline structure is correct and ready. The main blocker is the DO app availability.
