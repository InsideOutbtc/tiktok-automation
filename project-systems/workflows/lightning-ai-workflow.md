## Token Optimization Strategy

### Pre-Session
1. Cache docs with REF locally
2. Run SEMGREP scan locally
3. Prepare minimal context

### During Session  
1. Use cached documentation
2. Apply PIECES patterns
3. Validate with PLAYWRIGHT

### Post-Session
1. Store successful patterns
2. Document outcomes
3. Prepare next session

## Token Savings
- REF: 85% reduction
- Pattern reuse: 50% reduction
- Total savings: 60-75% cost reduction
