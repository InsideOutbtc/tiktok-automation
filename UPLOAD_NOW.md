# ðŸš€ UPLOAD VIDEOS NOW - MANUAL METHOD

Since yt-dlp is still installing, here's how to get videos processing RIGHT NOW:

## âœ… DO App Status: **HEALTHY**
Your DigitalOcean app is running at: https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app

## Option 1: Use Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Open Dashboard**: https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app/dashboard
2. Look for an upload button or interface
3. Upload any MP4 video file you have

## Option 2: Direct API Upload

If you have ANY video file on your Mac:

```bash
# Upload any video file
curl -X POST https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app/api/upload \
     -F "video=@/path/to/your/video.mp4" \
     -F "video_id=test_1"
```

## Option 3: Download Test Video Manually

1. Go to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScMzIvxBSi4
2. Use any YouTube downloader website (search "youtube downloader online")
3. Download as MP4
4. Upload using the curl command above

## Option 4: Wait for yt-dlp

The brew installation should complete in a few minutes. Then run:

```bash
./run_now.sh
```

## ðŸ“Š Check Processing Status

Once uploaded, videos will be processed into clips automatically:

1. **Dashboard**: https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app/dashboard
2. **API Status**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app/api/queue/status
   curl https://powerpro-automation-f2k4p.ondigitalocean.app/api/clips
   ```

## âœ… Scripts Are Fixed!

All your transit scripts now have the correct URL. Once yt-dlp installs, you can run:

- `python3 scripts/mac_transit.py` - Full transit system
- `python3 scripts/simple_transit.py` - Simple version
- `./run_now.sh` - Quick test

**Your system is ready!** Just need to get a video uploaded to start the processing pipeline.
